### Goal and Value of the Application
-> The goal of this application is for user to find the bakery they want to buy easily by using the sort and filter features.

### Usability Principles Considered
-> It is very effective, because it is very easy to use and easy to understand how to use it.\
-> It is very efficient, because user can get the bakeryitems they want by filtering and sorting.\
-> It is very consistent, because all the similar items are having the same format. \

### Organization of Components
-> The main file is the index.js file, and inside the index.js, we have our App.js file which contains all our app functions. 
-> The data I used in this app is stored in the bakery-data.jason file which I copied from the studio 5 and made some modification on it. 
-> There are 6 state in my program: "count", "stuff", "list", "sorted", "filter1", "filter2".
